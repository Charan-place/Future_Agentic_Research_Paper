## 📘 Abstract

Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) represents a transformative evolution in autonomous systems, characterized by goal-directed behavior, decision-making capabilities, and environmental adaptation with minimal human intervention.

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of future agentic AI systems, including:
- Architectural foundations
- Technical challenges (e.g., alignment, explainability, safety)
- Societal impacts (ethics, governance, economics)
- Emerging applications across various industries

The research aims to offer structured insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers navigating the evolving landscape of increasingly autonomous AI.
